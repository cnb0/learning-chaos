## Chaos Engineering Observability


- Chaos engineering is a highly collaborative activity. 
- When applied well, virtually everyone is responsible for exploring, surfacing, overcoming, and validating weaknesses in their systems. 
- That can lead to a lot of chaos engineering activity across a collection of systems at any moment in time.

- How can you keep chaos engineering from becoming, well, too chaotic? One key technique is chaos observability.

- how to bring your chaos experiments into the world of system observability. 
- Chaos observability enables you to surface, debug, and even visualize chaos experiment activities across your system in real time and 
  through time series recordings. 
- how chaos observability helps everyone in production be aware of chaos activities occurring within and across systems.

- Understand why itâ€™s imperative to make chaos engineering observable
- Learn how to bring chaos experiments and engineering into the overall system observability picture
- Make chaos observability actionable and difficult to ignore through alerts and Slack integration
